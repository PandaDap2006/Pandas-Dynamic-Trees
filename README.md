<h2 style="text-align: center;">Panda's Falling Trees makes all Minecraft trees fall after getting chopped down</h2>

#### About:
Panda's Falling Trees makes every tree fall like trees from [Dynamic trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamictrees), while still maintaining the original trees from Vanilla Minecraft.

The mod should support other mods if log and leaves blocks are a part of the log and leaves Block Tag
