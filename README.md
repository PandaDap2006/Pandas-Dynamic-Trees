## About:
Panda's Falling Trees makes every tree fall like trees from [Dynamic trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamictrees), while still maintaining the original trees from Vanilla Minecraft.

The mod should support other mods if log and leaves blocks are a part of the log and leaves Block Tag
