## About:
Panda's Falling Trees makes every tree fall like trees from [Dynamic trees](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamictrees), while still maintaining the original trees from Vanilla Minecraft.

The mod should support other mods if log and leaves blocks are a part of the log and leaves Block Tag

## Known Incompatibilities:
- **Optifine:** I cant promise that compatibility will ever be possible.
- **Wilder Wilds:** Game crash when mining trees. I recommend blacklisting the logs and leaves in the mod config.
- **Physics mod:** I will not make compatibility because it's not open sourced, if compatibility should ever be a thing, then the creators of the Physics mod should add it.
